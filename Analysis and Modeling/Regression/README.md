# Keynesian Savings Function 

This is a sample of a  piece of technical writing that I completed as an undergrad.We were required to complete a multiple regression analysis as well as report our findings to an audience with a basic statistical literacy.  I included this paper as it represents the first time I had worked with regression analysis-- I attribute my ongoing interest in the field of data science and economics to this assignment.

# Federal-Reserve-Internship-Portfolio

I have collected a small subset of my work that I believe demonstrates the skills desired for a summer intern. For convenience sake, I have organized my work into three directories outlined below. No single project or program included can be boiled down into a single category, so I have taken some creative liberty in assigning each entry. 

## Contents:

- **Analysis-and-Modeling**
- **Data-Collection**
- **Programming**


## Additional Material Upon Request
Upon request, I can provide you with access to additional repositories (non-public facing), containing ongoing/completed projects. Shown below are some projects that might be of interest if additional material is desired:  

### Racial Bias in the Florida Justice Department
There is no question that people of color are over-represented as a portion of those incarcerated. Determining why this is the status quo and what can be done about it is a challenging and import problem to solve. 

A local newspaper recently published a series laying blame for the status quo at the feet of Florida's judges. The series purports to be data-driven, yet makes no attempt to share the raw data and methodology used with the general public. A lack of transparency damages the credibility of the results published. 

This project seeks to accomplish the following goals in the short-run:
	
    1. Perform an analysis of the role Judge's play in sentencing bias and make these methodology transparent and the results reproducible.
    2. Construct a public database designed to investigate the sentencing data associated with Florida's judges


### The Last Words of Death Row Inmates | Sentiment Analysis
527 last statements have been made publicly available via the [Texas Department of Justice homepage](https://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html). I am particularly interested in this data set due to the time series component (starting in 1982) alongside an analysis of sentiment. Currently, I am in the exploratory phase; looking for changes in sentiment across time, differences across ethnicities, etc. 

### Axial and Azimuthal Dynamics of the Stanford Hall Thruster
Fortran 90 source code responsible for simulating the fluctuation of plasma within the Stanford Hall Thruster.  This research was funded in part by the II-VI Foundation and represents the cumulative efforts of many researchers.
